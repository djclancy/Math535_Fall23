# Math 535 Fall 2023: Mathematical Methods in Data Science

This github repo is used for the lecture notes that I write and present to the class, along with any suplementary material. Everything will be organized as the chapters in the course's "textbook."

The textbook can be found here [https://people.math.wisc.edu/~roch/mmids/notes.html](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~roch/mmids/notes.html)https://people.math.wisc.edu/~roch/mmids/notes.html).
